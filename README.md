#Ardulan
This is a project for Matane college.
It aim to learn electronics without programing the arduino and to control the arduino input/output from a computer or a smartphone.

#Compatibility
* Arduino MEGA 2560
* Arduino Leonardo/Uno

##Installation
Just download a release. The executable are portable

##Dependency (Server)
* Python (2.7 may work with 3.X)
* Tornado
* Tkinter (TCL,TK ...)
* cx_Freeze (optional)

##Dependency (Client)
* Arduino IDE

##TODO
- Test for multiple arduino
- add some security features
- Program arduino directly with the server
- Improve compatibility with Leonardo/Uno
